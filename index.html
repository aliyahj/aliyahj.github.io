<p> Hi I am an incoming junior at Benjamin N. Cardozo. I have to travel around an hour to get there and most of the time I get to my first period late. I have yet to learn how to manage my time and hopefully I'm not late for this program. I have a hate and love relationship with trains. So to get here on time i have to be extra early just in case of any delays. Don't get me wrong I love to travel and visit new places especially with friends. These friends always encourage me to try new things and i really appreciate it. This summer my friends and I decided to do an internship. Sadly we can't all be together because we all have different interests and goals. We dont even have the same classes but we are always active in the groupchat. Although I can be a very shy person I have gotten the chance to open up to them and really enjoy spending time with them.</p>


<p>And my favorite color is lavender.</p>
