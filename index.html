<h1>Aliyah</h1> 
<p> Hi I am an incoming junior at Benjamin N. Cardozo. I have to travel around an hour to get there and most of the time I get to my first period late. I have yet to learn how to manage my time and hopefully I'm not late for this program. I have a hate and love relationship with trains. So to get here on time i have to be extra early just in case of any delays. Don't get me wrong I love to travel and visit new places especially with friends. </p>
